**This project provides a simple yet powerful API for dynamic PDF generation using Node.js and Express.js. 
It is designed to receive data in a JSON format via a POST request and use that data to populate a PDF template. 
The generated document is then automatically saved to a designated pdf/ folder on the server. This solution is perfect 
for applications requiring automated creation of documents like invoices, reports, or certificates. It effectively
streamlines workflows by turning structured data into portable, professional-looking PDFs.**
